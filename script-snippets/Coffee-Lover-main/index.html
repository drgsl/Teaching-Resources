      The original domesticated coffee plant is said to have been from Harar,
      and the native population is thought to be derived from <b>Ethiopia</b>
      with distinct nearby populations in Sudan and Kenya.
      Coffee was primarily consumed in the Islamic world where it originated
      and was directly related to religious practices.
      The word <b>"coffee"</b> entered the English language in 1582 via the
      Dutch <b>koffie</b>, borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish <b>kahve</b>, in turn
      borrowed from the Arabic <b>qahwah</b>.

    <p class = "fromRight">
      There are four different types of coffee beans:
      Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, and Excelsa.
      The most common (and popular) are Arabica and Robusta,
      but you might get lucky and run into the other two.
    </p>
  <p class="fromLeft">
      <b>Arabica</b> tends to have a smoother, sweeter taste,
      with flavour notes of chocolate and sugar.
      They often also have hints of fruits or berries.
      <b>Robusta</b>, on the other hand, has a stronger, harsher and
      more bitter taste, with grainy or rubbery overtones.

        <br>
        For example, a ristretto is usually half of a volume of normale

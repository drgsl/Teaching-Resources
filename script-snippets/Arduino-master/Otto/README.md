# Otto DIY

This Repository have all open source Arduino sketch code files for Otto DIY an interactive robot that anyone can make!
Otto walks, dances, makes sounds and avoids obstacles. It is completely and truly open source, Arduino compatible, programmable, 3D printable.

This is the beginner version of Otto DIY, we decided to leave github for the basic CODES and only developers that want to support the project. For the latest changes please go and join our [Wikifactory](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/otto-diy) where you will find instruction manuals, 3D files and more, it is a similar platform much more easy to use, visual and simple for all the community to collaborate.

Please add a change log and your contact into file header.

Thanks for your contribution.

## For the quick start programming and learners
1. Download mBlock.cc Version 3; is an opensource software for easy programming Robot by Drop and Drag blocks. Based on Scratch 2.0 (MIT), beside sharing the great feature of graphical coding of Scratch, mBlock also integrates an Arduino Code generator for upload program into any Arduino based Hardware.
2. Add the Otto DIY Extension in mBlock software, swtich in the menu to Arduino mode
3. Drag and drop functions, dance, sounds and conditionals from robot Otto blocks
4. Connect, select Arduino Nano 328 and check the USB COM port
5. Upload your own code and Otto will follow each block command.

Alternatively you can use [Arduino Blocks (based on Google Blocly)](http://www.arduinoblocks.com/web/project/20999) and [Kittenblock (based on Scratch 3.0)](https://kittenbot-docs-en.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kittenbot/02InstallKittenblock.html) 

## For the advanced programmer
1. [Download & Install Arduino IDE 1.8.5 version](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) also [this driver if you have a clone board for PC] (http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_EXE.html), [or for MAC](http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_MAC_ZIP.html)
2. Copy all libraries to C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino\libraries (or wherever your library folder is installed)
3. Open  for example OttoDIY_smooth_criminal.ino, make sure in tools you have "Board: Arduino Nano" "Processor ATmega328" and your Otto is connected to the corresponding USB port if you have a new vesrion of Arduino use the old bootloader.
4. Upload code to your Otto and will dance!

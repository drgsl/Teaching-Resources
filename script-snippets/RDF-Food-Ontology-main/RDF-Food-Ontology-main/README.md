# RDF Food Ontology

## RDF Food Ontology
This repository contains a Python script (main.py) that processes an RDF file (food.rdf) representing a food ontology, and generates two text files: ontologie.txt and cuvinte_si_relatii.txt. It also asks the user questions related to the ontology.

## Requirements
To run the script, you need to have the following installed:

- rdflib (version 5.0.0 or higher)
- nltk (version 3.6.5 or higher)

## Usage

- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required packages using `pip`.
- Run the `main.py` script.

## Files
- `food.rdf`: the RDF file representing the food ontology.
- `ontologie.txt`: a text file containing a list of concepts, relationships and instances extracted from the ontology.
- `cuvinte_si_relatii.txt`: a text file containing pairs of words that are related, extracted from the ontology.

<p><big>[basic operations on files #1]</big>
<br>
<ol>
  <li><b>Examples of creating different types of files</b>.
   Type the commands that create the following:
   <ul>
    <li>i) a subdirectory named d1, in your home directory; two subdirectories d2 and d3, in d1 previously created; a d4 subdirectory, in d2 previously created.</li>
    <li>ii) several regular files, such as: p1.c and p2.c, in the previously created subdirectory d1; p3.c and p4.cpp, in the previously created subdirectory d2; p5.c and p6.h, in the previously created subdirectory d4.</li>
    <li>iii) using any of the text editors mentioned in the lesson, create a regular file named 15lines.txt, in the previously created subdirectory d1, whose contents will be the sequence of numbers from 1 to 15, each written separately, on a line of text.</li>
    <li>iv) in the previously created d2 subdirectory, create a hard link, called hardlnk1, to the previously created 15lines.txt file, as well as a symbolic link, called symlnk2, to the same file.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>

<pre id="lab1_ex0-1a" style="display:none;" class="stil_solutie">
<b>i)</b> A possible solution would be the following command - notice the repeated change of the current working directory:
cd
mkdir d1
cd d1
mkdir d2 d3
cd d2
mkdir d4
cd
ls -R d1  # to view the result of the creation operations

Another possible solution - without repeatedly changing the current working directory:
cd
mkdir d1 d1/d2 d1/d3 d1/d2/d4
ls -R d1/  # to view the result of the creation operations

Another possible solution - notice the use of the -p option of the mkdir command:

cd
mkdir -p d1/d3
mkdir --parents d1/d2/d4
ls -R d1  # to view the result of the creation operations

<b>ii)</b> A possible solution would be the following command sequence:
cd
touch d1/p1.c d1/p2.c d1/d2/p3.c d1/d2/p4.cpp d1/d2/d4/p5.c d1/d2/d4/p6.h
ls -lR d1/  # to view the result of the creation operations

Another possible solution is with the repeated change of the current working director, similar as above. Try to write it yourself!

<b>iii)</b> A possible solution would be (instead of mcedit you can use any other text editor):
cd
mcedit d1/15lines.txt
#Note: in the editor window that appears on the screen, enter the specified sequence of numbers and then save (F2) and exit the editor (F10).
cat d1/15lines.txt # to view the result

<b>iv)</b> A possible solution would be:
cd
ln d1/15lines.txt d1/d2/hardlnk1
ln -s ../15lines.txt d1/d2/symlnk2
  # Remark: Note that in the case of symbolic links, the relative path of the target must be specified relative to the directory where that symbolic link will be created!
ls -lR d1  # to view the result
  # Note: now we can refer to the 15lines.txt file by any of its 3 names (aliases), for example:
cat d1/15lines.txt
cat d1/d2/hardlnk1
cat d1/d2/symlnk2
</pre>
<br><br>

  <li><b>Examples of copying, moving and deleting different types of files</b>.
   Type the commands that perform the following file operations:
   <ul>
    <li>i) copy the previously created d4 subdirectory to the previously created d3 subdirectory; copy the previously created p4.cpp file to the previously created d3 subdirectory so that the created copy is called p4bis.cpp.</li>
    <li>ii) move the file d1/d3/p4bis.cpp, created in the previous step, to the subdirectory d1/d3/d4, keeping its name unchanged;
        	rename the file d1/d3/d4/p5.c, created in the previous step, in p5.cpp, without changing its location (i.e., the directory where it is located);
			move the file d1/d3/d4/p6.h, created in the previous step, to the subdirectory d1/d2, changing its name to p6bis.h.</li>
    <li>iii) delete the previously created d1/d3/d4 subdirector, including all its contents.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>

<button onclick="myToggle('lab1_ex0-1b')">Show / Hide some possible solutions</button>

<pre id="lab1_ex0-1b" style="display:none;" class="stil_solutie">
<b>i)</b> A possible solution would be:
cd
cp -R d1/d2/d4 d1/d3                 # -R: recursive copying, i.e. with all the contents of that directory
cp -i d1/d2/p4.cpp d1/d3/p4bis.cpp   # -i: requires confirmation in case of overwriting
ls -lR d1/  # to view the result of the copy operations

<b>ii)</b> A possible solution would be:
cd
mv -i d1/d3/p4bis.cpp d1/d3/d4/      # -i: requires confirmation in case of overwriting
mv -i d1/d3/d4/p5.c d1/d3/d4/p5.cpp
mv -i d1/d3/d4/p6.h d1/d2/p6bis.h
ls -lR d1/  # to view the result of the move/rename operations

<b>iii)</b> A first solution would be:
cd
rmdir d1/d3/d4
  # Note: the rmdir command will error, saying that the directory is not empty.
ls -R d1/d3/d4   # we look at what files it contains, and we delete them first...
rm d1/d3/d4/p5.cpp
rm d1/d3/d4/...  # repeat this step for the other files that may still exist in that directory!
rmdir d1/d3/d4   # after we clear the directory, we can delete it with rmdir.

Another possible solution is using recursive deletion:
cd
rm -R -i d1/d3/d4/  # -R: recursive deletion, -i: requires confirmation for each file to be deleted

<p><big>[basic operations on files #2]</big>
<br>
<ol>
  <li><b>Examples of viewing the contents of text files with various commands</b>.
   Type the commands that perform the following file operations:
   <ul>
    <li>i) view the contents of the previously created d1/15lines.txt file, displayed in the natural order of the text lines and in the reverse order, respectively.</li>
    <li>ii) view the file <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>, which contains information about the user accounts on the system you are working on,
		so that the displayed view is paused "when passing from one screen to another"; repeat this operation, with the possibility of "navigating" in both directions.</li>
	<li>iii) similarly, study the information about the user groups on the system you are working on, by looking at the file <tt>/etc/group</tt>.</li>
    <li>iv) view the contents of the previously created d1/15lines.txt file, displaying only the first N lines, respectively the last N lines, where the N value is specified as the command argument.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>

<button onclick="myToggle('lab1_ex0-2a')">Show / Hide some possible solutions</button>

<pre id="lab1_ex0-2a" style="display:none;" class="stil_solutie">
<b>i)</b> A possible solution would be:
cat d1/15lines.txt  # for the natural order of text lines in the file
tac d1/15lines.txt  # for the reverse order

Another solution:
cat -n d1/15lines.txt   # the displayed text lines are preceded by the order number of each in the file

<b>ii)</b> A possible solution would be:
more /etc/passwd    # navigation, in one direction, is done by pressing the SPACE key to move to the next screen
less /etc/passwd    # navigation in both directions is done by pressing either the up / down arrow keys (to move to the next line) or the PgUp / PgDn keys (to move to the next screen)

<i>Remark</i>: the "database" about user accounts, i.e. the /etc/passwd file, contains text lines conforming to the following template:
<big><i>username</i>:x:<i>User ID</i>:<i>Group ID</i> of the user's primary group:<i>user's personal data</i>:<i>home directory</i>:<i>login shell</i></big>

<b>iii)</b> Similar to the previous point:
more /etc/group    # navigation, in one direction, is done by pressing the SPACE key to move to the next screen
less /etc/group    # navigation in both directions is done by pressing either the up / down arrow keys (to move to the next line) or the PgUp / PgDn keys (to move to the next screen)

<i>Remark</i>: the "database" about user groups, i.e. the /etc/group file, contains text lines conforming to the following template:
<big><i>groupname</i>:x:<i>Group ID</i>:a (posible null) <i>list of usernames</i>, thus describing the membership of the users in secondary groups</big>

<b>iv)</b> A possible solution would be:
head d1/15lines.txt        # displays the first 10 lines of text (N=10 in this case)
head -n 5 d1/15lines.txt   # displays the first 5 lines of text
head -n -5 d1/15lines.txt  # displays all lines (from the beginning of the file) except the last 5 lines of text

tail d1/15lines.txt        # displays the last 10 lines of text (N=10 in this case), in natural order, not the inverted one as in the tac command!
tail -n 5 d1/15lines.txt   # displays the last 5 lines of text, in natural order
tail -n +5 d1/15lines.txt  # displays all lines, starting with the 5th line, in the natural order (basically, it displays the whole file, except the first 4 lines of text)
</pre>

  <li><b>Examples of obtaining file information, with various commands</b>.
   Enter the commands that provide us with the following file information:
   <ul>
    <li>i) find out what kind of content the following files have (without explicitly viewing their content with the commands exemplified above):<br>
		<tt>/etc/passwd</tt> , <tt>/usr/bin/write</tt> , <tt>/usr/share/man/man1/write.1.gz</tt> , <tt>/usr/include/fcntl.h</tt> .</li>
    <li>ii) view the metadata (i.e., properties) associated with the file <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>;
		then display only the following metadata associated with it: permissions in symbolic notation, size in bytes, date of last modification and its name.</li>
	<li>iii) similarly, study the metadata information associated with the file <tt>/etc/group</tt>.</li>
	<li>iv) edit various metadata associated with the previously created <tt>d1/15lines.txt</tt> file.</li>

<pre id="lab1_ex0-2b-b" style="display:none;" class="stil_explicatie">

<b>iv)</b> First, let's look at the current value of the metadata associated with the d1/15lines.txt file, which we created earlier:
cd
stat d1/15lines.txt
# A possible example of the result displayed by the stat command might be the following:
#
#   File: ‘d1/15lines.txt’
#   Size: 35              Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file
# Device: fd05h/64773d    Inode: 12692988    Links: 2
# Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: ( 1019/vidrascu)   Gid: (  503/   profs)
# Access: 2020-02-21 13:14:54.414890033 +0200
# Modify: 2020-02-21 13:12:38.780513539 +0200
# Change: 2020-02-21 13:14:03.775005209 +0200
#  Birth: -

Some of these metadata cannot be modified directly, but only indirectly, for example:
- if we add additional content to a file, or "delete" from it, then the Size field (i.e., file length in bytes) will be updated accordingly;
- if we "move" the file to a directory that is stored on another disk, or at least a partition other than the disk / partition that stores the directory where the file was originally located,
  then the Device and Inode fields will be updated accordingly.

Another part of these metadata we can modify them as desired, using specific commands:

- the File field (i.e., filename): we can change it using the mv command (see the examples above)
- the Links field (i.e., the number of hard links that file has): we can modify it using the ln and rm commands (see the examples above)
  For example, we execute the command:
  cd
  rm d1/d2/hardlnk1  # the previously created alias will be deleted, and the value of the Links field will decrease from 2 to 1.
- the first Access field (i.e., file access permissions): we can modify it using the chmod command
  Illustration:
  cd
  chmod ug+x d1/15lines.txt   # add (+) the right x for the owner (u) and for the groupmates of the owner (g). All other 9-2=7 permissions remain unchanged!
  chmod o-r  d1/15lines.txt   # the right r for the rest of the world (o) is eliminated (-). All other 9-1=8 permissions remain unchanged!
  chmod 741  d1/15lines.txt   # all 9 permissions are completely modified, according to the meaning of the octal notation 741 = rwx(u),r--(g),--x(o) !
- the fields Uid (i.e., owner ID) and Gid (i.e., owner group ID): we can change them using the chown and chgrp commands
- the second Access field (i.e., the <i>last access time</i> of that file) and the Modify field (i.e., the <i>last modify time</i> of that file): we can modify them using the touch command

cut -f1,3 -d: /etc/passwd

Other solution - remark the spaces between each option and its associated value:

cut -f 1,3 -d : /etc/passwd

Another solutions - remark the order of the options and the arguments:

cut -f1,3 /etc/passwd -d:
cut -d: /etc/passwd -f1,3
cut /etc/passwd -d: -f1,3

More solutions - remark the use of options specified by the long format instead of the short one:

cut --fields=1,3 --delimiter=: /etc/passwd
cut --fields 1,3 --delimiter : /etc/passwd

Note: if using long format for specifing the options, the command will give error if you omit the spaces and/or the equal sign between the name of the option and its associated value:

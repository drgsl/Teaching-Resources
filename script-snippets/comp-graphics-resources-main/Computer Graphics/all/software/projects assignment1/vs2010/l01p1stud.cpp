/**********************************
  
  The reader of this program should not limit
  himself/herself to the comments of this 
  program.

  If one wants to read more about the syntax and 
  the semantics of OpenGL functions used in this
  program, one should read the beginning of the
  paragraph 2.6 "Begin/End Paradigm", the 
  paragraph 2.6.1 "Begin and End Objects" from the 
  file glspec15.pdf at page 25/333 and the index
  from the end of that file. One could also
  read the references to the GLUT functions from
  the file glut-3.spec.pdf.

  Start from the function "main" and follow the 
  instruction flow, paying attention to the fact that
  this program belongs to the event-driven programming
  paradigm. So pay attention to what happens when 
  the user presses a key, moves the mouse or presses a
  mouse button. There are also some special events: the
  redrawing of the application window, etc.
  Identify what happens in the program when one of these
  events occurs.

/**********************************

 If you want to use the GLUT utility toolkit 
 you must include the header file <GL/glut.h> .

 This header file will include automatically
 the header files needed in order to use 
 OpenGL library : <GL/gl.h> and <GL/glu.h> .
 You don't need to include these two header files
 in your program.

 The OpenGL library functions are prefixed by gl,
 those in GLU by glu and those in GLUT by glut

 In the following it is desirable that the 
 students will use this program like a framework
 (or like a "skeleton") for their future programs
 at Computer Graphics course.

// Pay attention to the order of include-file directives !
// That's important, in order to avoid some compile-time errors.

  The reader of this program should not limit
  himself/herself to the comments of this 
  program.

  If one wants to read more about the syntax and 
  the semantics of OpenGL functions used in this
  program, one should read the beginning of the
  paragraph 2.6 "Begin/End Paradigm", the 
  paragraph 2.6.1 "Begin and End Objects" from the 
  file glspec15.pdf at page 25/333 and the index
  from the end of that file. One could also
  read the references to the GLUT functions from
  the file glut-3.spec.pdf.

  Start from the function "main" and follow the 
  instruction flow, paying attention to the fact that
  this program belongs to the event-driven programming
  paradigm. So pay attention to what happens when 
  the user presses a key, moves the mouse or presses a
  mouse button. There are also some special events: the
  redrawing of the application window, etc.
  Identify what happens in the program when one of these
  events occurs.

      Maximum/minimum values of x and y are computed.
      These values will be further used in scaling the
      original graph of the curve. 
      These values are stored in the variables
      xmax, ymax, xmin, ymin: e.g., xmax is initialized
      with a value smaller than any of possible values
      of x; if in doubt or you cannot estimate it, use 
      DBL_MIN instead (or DBL_MAX for minimum values).
      These DBL_* constants are found in <float.h> which
      need to be included.
      E.g., xmax is initialized with a - b - 1 because
      x(t) = a +/- b * cos(t) and for t in (-pi/2, pi/2),
      cos(t) is in (0, 1), so b * cos(t) is in (0, b),
      so +/- b * cos(t) is in (-b, b), so x(t) is in
      (a-b, a+b) and one can safely choose a-b-1 because
      a-b-1 < a-b. 
      For y(t) we see that in its expression appears
      tan(t) which varies in (-inf,+inf) when t
      varies in (-pi/2, pi/2).

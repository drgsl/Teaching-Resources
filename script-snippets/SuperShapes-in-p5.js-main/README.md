# SuperShapes in p5.js 🌟
Welcome to my SuperShapes project in p5.js! This project allows you to generate complex and beautiful shapes using SuperShapes, a geometric concept discovered by Johan Gielis.

## 🔍 About SuperShapes
SuperShapes are a type of shape that can produce a wide variety of complex forms. They were discovered by Johan Gielis, a Belgian physicist, in 1999. SuperShapes are based on the mathematical concept of parametric equations, which allow you to generate shapes by varying different parameters.

## 🔧 Usage
To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can adjust the parameters in the `sketch.js` file to generate different SuperShapes.

## 🎥 Demo
Check out the [live demo](https://editor.p5js.org/BobuDragos/full/SJVTU-jC7) to see the SuperShapes in action!

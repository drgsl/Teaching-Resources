# Requirements based on discussions in the class:

- ✅ Comment and properly format the source code of your programs (otherwise: -0.5 points)
- ✅ Use the naming conventions for writing Java code. "Naming conventions make programs more understandable by making them
  easier to read." (otherwise: -0.5 points)
- ✅ Use appropriate collections in order to represent data (otherwise: -0.5 points)
- ✅  Pay attention to exception handling (otherwise: -0.5 points)
- N/A Create your own types of exceptions to report abnormal events related to application execution.
- ✅ Organize your classes and interfaces in packages.
- ✅ ReadMe

# Problem Description

- ✅ Create an object-oriented model for your application and implement the commands.
- ✅ The command stop should "gracefully" stop the server - it will not accept new threads but it will finish those in progress. When there are no more threads, it will shutdown. Note: when .accept() method will be off, one more thread can be established.
- ✅ Implement a timeout for a connection (a number of minutes). If the server does not receive any command from a logged in client in the specified period of time, it will terminate the connection.
- 
- (+0.5p) Create a SVG representation of the social network, using Apache Batik, or other technology.
- (+0.5p) Upload a HTML document containing the social network representation directly from the application to a Web server. You may use JCraft for connecting to a server using SFTP and transferring a file (or a similar solution).

# 🌳 p5FractalTree
Welcome to p5FractalTree, an implementation of a fractal tree using p5.js!

## 📜 Overview
This project is an interactive visualization of a fractal tree, which is a recursive structure that resembles the branches of a tree. The tree is generated using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding.

## 🎥 Demo

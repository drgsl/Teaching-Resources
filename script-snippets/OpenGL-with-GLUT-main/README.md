# OpenGL with GLUT

This repository contains a simple C/C++ program that demonstrates how to use the GLUT library to create a simple OpenGL window.

## Prerequisites
Before you can run this program, you'll need to have the GLUT library installed on your system.

## Functionality
There are several display functions that use different OpenGL drawing primitives to create shapes and lines.

- `Display1()` draws two intersecting lines in blue and red, respectively, and a horizontal line in the middle.
- `Display2()` draws a series of connected lines in red.
- `Display3()` draws four individual points in red.
- `Display4()` draws a line strip in red connecting four points.
- `Display5()` draws a closed loop of connected lines in red connecting four points.
- `Display6()` draws two triangles in red, one pointing upwards and one pointing downwards.
- `Display7()` draws a quadrilateral in red.
- `Display8()` draws a convex polygon in blue, specifically a hexagon.

Switching between the displays can be done by pressing the keyboard keys 1 through 8.
